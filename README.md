# Git Bash for Mac

Did you (finally) migrate from Windows to Mac and the only thing you miss is the lovely Git Bash?
You have no idea what the Git Bash is (or Windows for that matters) and yet you really want to improve your Git experience on Mac?

Follow these steps:
1. run `./install.sh` from the terminal;
2. open `Terminal` -> `Preferences` and select the `Pro` theme;
3. enjoy!

More info about the rationale behind the `install.sh` can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash).
